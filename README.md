# LiDAR-based-3D-Surveillance-System-using-FRDM-K64F-Microcontroller.
Mounted LiDAR on a 360-degree rotating structure is facilitated by a Servo mechanism to map points on the spherical coordinate system. Obtained 3D map is used to localize points of interest and upload their coordinates to Cloud via WIFI, using IOT terminologies.
